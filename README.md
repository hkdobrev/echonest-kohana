Kohana 3.2 module to work with the EchoNest API.
====

***[EchoNest](http://the.echonest.com/) is a open service which provides access to information about millions of artists and songs. It also supports track analyzing, dynamic playlist generation and more.***

The module is using the [non-official PHP SDK](https://github.com/bshaffer/php-echonest-api) for the [EchoNest API](developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/).

It also provides basic routes, controller and an instance method for easier use.

The controller is more an example right now, but I will add a lot more functionality soon!

**Please do not hesitate to request some original use of the API in the module from the Issues page.**
