Kohana 3.2 module to work with the EchoNest API.
====
====

[EchoNest](http://the.echonest.com/) is a open service which provides access to information about millions of artists and songs. It also supports track analyzing, dynamic playlist generation and more.

The module is using the non-official PHP SDK for the EchoNest API - avaiable [on GitHub](https://github.com/bshaffer/php-echonest-api)

It also provides basic routes, controller and an instance method for easier use.

The controller is more an example right now, but I will add a lot more functionality soon!

Please do not hesitate to request some original use of the API in the module from the Issues page.
